🎧 Audio Modem using FSK Modulation

This project implements a basic audio modem that uses Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) to transmit and receive text messages using sound waves. It converts strings into audio signals and back, effectively enabling communication via computer speakers and microphones.

📁 Project Structure

fsk_transmissor.py – Converts a user-input string to an audio signal using FSK and plays it through the speakers.

fsk_receptor.py – Listens for an incoming FSK-modulated audio signal, detects a synchronization header, and decodes the original message.

.idea/ files – Project settings for JetBrains IDEs (e.g., PyCharm).

⚙️ How It Works

Bit 0 is encoded as a sine wave at 18,000 Hz.

Bit 1 is encoded as a sine wave at 20,000 Hz.

A predefined header (10101010) is sent at the beginning of every transmission for synchronization.

Example

Sender side:

python fsk_transmissor.py

Enter the message to transmit when prompted.

Receiver side:

python fsk_receptor.py

The script records audio, waits for the header, and prints the decoded message.

🔧 Requirements

Python 3.8+

numpy

sounddevice

scipy

Install dependencies with:

pip install numpy sounddevice scipy

🚀 Use Cases

Simple educational demonstrations of digital signal processing.

Offline communication over air using sound.

Understanding FSK modulation and demodulation.

📌 Notes

Works best in a quiet environment.

Accuracy depends on microphone and speaker quality.
